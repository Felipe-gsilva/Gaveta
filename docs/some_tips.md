Im writting almost everything in a snake_case style. Yet, the structure is a bit different:
- exported types, such as BTree, GenericLinkedList and so on are written in this CamelCase like style. Im doing this to further indicate what should be API exported
- internal structs, unions, variables and everything else shall be written in snake_case.
